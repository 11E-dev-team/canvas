# Problem
Our team set out to address one of the main problems of distance learning in schools - lack of students' involvement in the educational process during lessons and psychological hindrance to learning, distance between teachers and students, because of which students may, without realizing it, get distracted from the lecture without noticing it, distract from the lecture and start doing their own things, while teachers don't feel the response of students and have no control over students' work

# Customers
We identified three groups of users with different roles and interests:
- Teachers
- Uninterested students
- Interested students

## POV
__How can we help__ Aleksander Zhigulev, chemistry teacher

__In what?__ In leading distance learning classes, tracking student work and their engagement with the lesson in real time

__Why>__ Because now Alexander Zhigulyov is unable to monitor students' work during distance lessons, students often become uninvolved in the lesson, distracted and poorly assimilate the material and Alexander does not feel the feedback during his lecture and has to speak in a "void".
